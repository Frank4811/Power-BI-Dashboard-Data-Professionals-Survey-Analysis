# 📊 Data Professional Survey Dashboard

## 🧠 Overview
This project presents insights from a survey of 630 data professionals across various countries and job roles. Using **Power BI**, I cleaned the raw data with **Power Query** and built an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as salary trends, work/life balance satisfaction, and job entry difficulty.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- Excel (.xlsx) as source file

## 🧼 Data Cleaning
Using **Power Query**, I performed:
- Column renaming for consistency
- Removal of null or irrelevant data
- Transformation of date and categorical fields
- Data type normalization for analysis

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Country of Survey Takers**: Tree map visualizing respondent distribution
- **Average Salary by Job Title**: Bar chart with role-wise salary comparison
- **Favorite Programming Language**: Count of votes by language and job title
- **Difficulty Breaking into Data**: Donut chart with percentages
- **Happiness with Work/Life Balance & Salary**: KPI gauges on a scale of 0–10
- **Survey Demographics**:

  - Average age: 30

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Python** is the most popular language among data professionals.
- **Data Scientists** have the highest average salary.
- Many respondents find it challenging to break into the data industry.
- Satisfaction is higher for **work/life balance** (5.74) than **salary** (4.27).
